Task 1: For our group project, I would like to work on an AI-based autonomous navigation system that uses informed search algorithms, such as A*, to plan optimal paths in dynamic environments. The system would be designed for small-scale autonomous robots, such as warehouse delivery bots or indoor service robots, that need to navigate efficiently while avoiding obstacles. The primary users would be robotics developers and organizations that rely on automated movement in structured environments like warehouses or hospitals. The project would focus on implementing and comparing search strategies, evaluating heuristic effectiveness, and handling dynamic changes in the environment. Using the agile development process would be a strong fit for this idea because the project can be developed incrementally. We could begin with a basic grid-based pathfinding implementation, then iteratively add features such as improved heuristics, dynamic obstacle handling, and performance evaluation. Agile would allow us to continuously test and refine our algorithms, incorporate feedback, and adjust scope as needed. However, potential challenges include ensuring correct implementation of search algorithms, managing integration between simulation and planning components, and handling dynamic obstacles efficiently without significantly increasing computational cost. Additionally, coordinating tasks among group members and maintaining consistent coding standards could present organizational challenges.

Task 3: A functional requirement describes what a system must do, while a non-functional requirement defines how well the system must perform. For example, in an online telehealth platform, a functional requirement could be: “The system shall allow patients to schedule, reschedule, and cancel virtual appointments with licensed providers.” A non-functional requirement for the same system could be: “The system shall support at least 5,000 concurrent video sessions with an average latency of less than 200 milliseconds.” The first defines behavior, while the second specifies performance and quality constraints. Extreme Programming (XP) and Scrum are both agile methodologies, but they differ in focus and practices. XP emphasizes strong engineering practices such as pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), continuous integration, and refactoring. It is highly prescriptive about coding standards and technical discipline. Scrum, on the other hand, focuses more on project management structure, defining roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team), events (sprints, daily standups), and artifacts (product backlog, sprint backlog). Scrum does not mandate specific engineering practices; it concentrates on iterative planning and team coordination. Scrum and Kanban differ primarily in structure and workflow control. Scrum operates in fixed-length iterations called sprints, with committed work selected at the beginning of each sprint. Changes during a sprint are discouraged. Kanban, however, is continuous-flow based and does not use time-boxed iterations. Work items move across a visual board, and limits are placed on work in progress (WIP) to optimize flow. Scrum is structured and role-driven, whereas Kanban is more flexible and emphasizes flow efficiency and limiting bottlenecks. A sprint review and a retrospective serve different purposes. A sprint review is held at the end of a sprint to demonstrate completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback on the product increment. It focuses on the product and its functionality. A retrospective, in contrast, is an internal team meeting focused on process improvement. The team reflects on what went well, what did not, and how to improve collaboration, workflow, and practices in the next sprint. Story points are a relative measure of effort used in agile estimation. They represent the overall complexity, risk, and effort required to complete a user story, rather than specific time units like hours. Teams use story points to estimate backlog items and to calculate velocity, which helps forecast how much work can be completed in future sprints. Story points promote relative estimation and reduce the pressure associated with time-based estimates.
